Object-Oriented Programming

This game was created as part of a project for Codecademy's Computer Science course. The project was designed to teach students about object-oriented programming, specifically how to use classes and objects to create complex programs.

The code is organized into several classes, including Deck, PokerHand, and Game. Each class has its own properties and methods, and they work together to create a functional game.

    Improve the UI by adding graphics and sound effects.
